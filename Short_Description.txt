This react app has used libraries like Ag-grid, axios and material ui. Basically, Ag-grid is a grid library for Javascript such as React, Angular,
Vue and others. Mainly, Ag-grid is used for features like sorting, filtering, grouping large amount of data in table format. In React, we can use 
props like rowData and columnDefs to define the data and the columns of the grid.

The provided code creates a React application that uses the Ag-Grid module to display a table of country details. It retrieves the information
from the 'https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all' API which was provided in the coding task and renders it in the grid. When a row of any country is 
clicked, a modal window presenting more information about the chosen country opens up. The modal contains details such the country's common name, 
capital, region, and languages.There is a close button on the modal as well.
 
This app contains two pages "Main.js" which is also a landing page when we start the server we are redirected to this page with route "/". The main 
page contains the welcoming message to the app which is written at the center of the page. The next page "Countries.js" which contains the list of 
countries details are fetched from api and kept using Ag grid in table format. Both of the pages contains Navbar for navigating from one 
page to another. Navbar is one of the Component which is imported inside the index.js and kept it above the app component so that navbar renders 
inside every page. Navbar is made using material UI library.
library.

I got to learn about new things like Ag-grid and React-modal. I enjoyed making modal pop up. Also, I managed to replicate the given figma design
to some level. Thank you for providing me with such educational task.
